# Carmageddon Simulator

Carmageddon Simulator is an information technology project developped by first year engineering student of the École nationale des sciences géographiques. 
This simulation project provides the possibility to an urban planner to simulate the behaviour of cars and pedestrians at an intersection. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Those instructions assume you are on a debian-like linux system.

### Prerequisites

Carmageddon Simulator is developped in Java. So you need a version of the JDK if you aim at modifying the code.
There is no need for other languages or platforms. It was tested with versions 8, 11 and 12 of the JDK.
To download the Java Development Kit (JDK):
http://jdk.java.net/12/ or https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html


### Retrieving the sources
If you haven't installed git yet, open a shell and run:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
Then retrieve the code using:
```
git clone https://github.com/Stakhan/CarmageddonSimulator
```

```


## Compiling the sources


### Launching the app

Launch the .jar file.

```
java -jar CarmageddonSimulator.jar
```

A first window appear, choose your size preferences there. Then, you get the main window where you can watch the main window  can adjust the different live parameters and events.
